AuBlog is a Blogger client which lets you publish and draft blog entries for your BlogSpot or Blogger site. It offers an interactive draft tree so you can work on multiple entries at once (try out the web version here: http://aublog.net/webinterface/view_draft_tree.html).

AuBlog was designed to blog "eyes-free" while biking. It is designed to take dictations while you are somewhere with no internet connection (ie, can't use Google Voice for dictation) and build these dictations towards a new blog entry, or work on many entries concurrently.

AuBlog was designed by iLanguage Lab, an Open Source research lab in Montreal, Canada.
