## What is AuBlog ##

AuBlog is a colorful Blogger client which lets you publish and draft blog entries for your BlogSpot or Blogger site. It offers an interactive draft tree so you can work on multiple entries at once (try out the web version here: [http://aublog.net/webinterface/view\_draft\_tree.html ](http://aublog.net/webinterface/view_draft_tree.html)).

AuBlog was designed to blog "eyes-free" while biking. It is designed to take dictations while you are somewhere with no internet connection (ie, can't use Google Voice for dictation) and build these dictations towards a new blog entry, or work on many entries concurrently. You might never publish some of those drafts, but you always have access to them. (There's a button to email your drafts to yourself, or export them in the Settings so that you'll never lose your thoughts).

### Comparison with the Official Blogger Client ###

  * 90% users will prefer the Official Blogger client, it has a lot more features than AuBlog. I developed AuBlog so I could blog while biking to work. If you also work on blog entries while walking, biking, cooking, etc or in other situations where you cannot type, but you can talk, AuBlog might be for you.
  * AuBlog Works on well on small screen phones and larger screen tablets too. According to reviews the Official Blogger Client doesn't work well on tablets, but the Blogger website itself is good on tablets.
