			<p>
				AuBlog is a colorful Blogger client which lets you publish and draft
				blog entries for your BlogSpot or Blogger site. It offers an
				interactive draft tree so you can work on multiple entries at once
				(try out the web version here: <a
					href="http://aublog.net/webinterface/view_draft_tree.html"
					target="_blank">http://aublog.net/webinterface/view_draft_tree.html</a>).
			</p>

			<p>AuBlog was designed to blog "eyes-free" while biking. It is designed to take dictations while you are somewhere with no internet connection (ie, can't use Google Voice for dictation) and build these dictations towards a new blog entry, or work on many entries concurrently. You might never publish some of those drafts, but you always have access to them. (There's a button to email your drafts to yourself, or export them in the Settings so that you'll never lose your thoughts). </p>

				</span>
			</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>90% users will prefer the Official Blogger client, it has a
					lot more features than AuBlog. I developed AuBlog so I could blog
					while biking to work. If you also work on blog entries while
					walking, biking, cooking, etc or in other situations where you
					cannot type, but you can talk, AuBlog might be for you.</li>
				<li>AuBlog works on well on small screen phones and larger
					screen tablets too. According to reviews the Official Blogger
					Client doesn't work well on tablets, but the Blogger website itself
					is good on tablets.</li>

			<p>AuBlog has three main screens</p>

			<ol>
				<li>View Drafts Tree</li>
				<li>Edit Blog Entry</li>
				<li>Settings</li>
			</ol>
			AuBlog lets you draft blog entries in two ways

			<ul>
				<li>Traditional Blog Client: typing, editing, saving, typing
					some more</li>
				<li>Blog/Podcast Client: speaking, listening, revising and
					speaking again</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>
				<span class="mw-headline" id="wiki-1_View_Drafts_Tree_Screen"><a
					name="wiki-1_View_Drafts_Tree_Screen">1. View Drafts Tree
						Screen</a>
				</span>
			</h3>

			<img src="images/draftstree.png" width="100" />


			<p>On this screen you can navigate your previous blog posts
				(published and unpublished). Instead of a list of drafts, its
				presented as a tree so that when you change your post, a new
				"daughter" is saved under that post. It might be confusing when you
				start, but it can also be really helpful to "rewind" to a previous
				version, or to start a new direction off the same post. AuBlog
				starts with some sample entries so you can see what the Drafts Tree
				looks like.</p>

			<p>The Tree shape is probably most useful if you are blogging via
				speaking. Sometimes you listen to what you recorded and you decide
				"branch" out in another direction. This is why a tree is more useful
				than a list.</p>
				
				<p>You can listen to your blog entry by <b>long pressing</b> on the node that you want to hear.</p>

			<h3>
				<span class="mw-headline" id="wiki-2_Edit_Blog_Entry_Screen"><a
					name="wiki-2_Edit_Blog_Entry_Screen">2. Edit Blog Entry Screen</a>
				</span>
			</h3>


			<img src="images/editUseViaRecording.png" width="100" />

			<p>On this screen you can type (or use Google Voice to dictate
				sentence by sentence). This is basically the same interface that you
				would have on any other Android Blogger client. You can use WYSIWYG
				editing by selecting text then clicking on the buttons to make it
				bold, underlined etc. To preview the marked-up version, click on the
				Preview button with the green checkmark. It will open up the preview
				pane below the edit area.</p>

			<p>The Edit screen also lets you record long dictations. The
				dictations are saved in an audio folder on the SDCARD so that your
				thoughts don't "disappear into thin air." You can listen to them
				again, or do with them as you wish. (Go to the Settings screen to
				Open the audio folder). AuBlog attaches them to the draft tree so
				that you can listen to your drafts in the order of their "family
				tree".</p>

			<h3>
				<span class="mw-headline" id="wiki-3_Settings_Screen"><a
					name="wiki-3_Settings_Screen">3. Settings Screen</a>
				</span>
			</h3>

			<img src="images/settings.png" width="100" />

			<p>On this screen you can add your Blogger account so that you
				can publish your blog entries. On the settings screen you also have
				other options like exporting your drafts, turning Text to Speech
				(TTS) on or off. AuBlog can read your blog entries to you when you
				click saveif you are) this way you can use AuBlog "eyes free" when
				its difficult to look at the screen (while walking, in direct
				sunlight etc).</p>

			<h2>
				<span class="mw-headline"
					id="wiki-How_to_get_the_most_out_of_AuBlog"><a
					name="wiki-How_to_get_the_most_out_of_AuBlog">How to get the
						most out of AuBlog</a>
				</span>
			</h2>

			<p>AuBlog is designed to take notes while you are somewhere with
				no internet connection (ie, can't use Google Voice for dictation),
				and you want to build towards a new blog entry, or work on many
				entries concurrently. You might never publish some of those drafts,
				but you always have access to them. (There's a button to email your
				drafts to yourself, or export them in the Settings so that you don't
				lose your thoughts if you lose your Android or you stop using
				AuBlog).</p>

			<p>Ideally AuBlog is designed to help you go from Notes to Blog +
				Podcast with minimal typing. AuBlog wants to transcribe your
				dictations for you so that you have the least amount of typing to
				do. Currently this is only possible by sending the audio to a
				server, and getting back some transcriptions. We are working to
				integrate a couple of Open Source projects to make this work on the
				phone itself, but be for-warned, you will still have to do some
				corrections to make the transcription actually match what you said.
				Usually these machine transcriptions aren't that good.</p>
